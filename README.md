## Description

The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is one of the most famous multivariate data set used for testing various Machine Learning Algorithms.
The dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.
