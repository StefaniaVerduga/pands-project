## Description

The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is one of the most famous multivariate data set used for testing various Machine Learning Algorithms.
The dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. 

## Dataset Information

The Iris Dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of Iris plant.
Attribute information:

1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm
5. Class: Iris Setosa - Iris Versicolor - Iris Virginica
